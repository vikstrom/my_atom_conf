Shell Environment\n\nThis package allows you to easily grab the login environment for the user even if the current process was launched from a GUI with little or no environment specified. This allows things like `rvm` to run correctly.\n\nThis was originally developed for Atom's [Script Runner](https://atom.io/packages/script-runner). Please feel free to suggest changes or improvements. PRs welcome.\n\n## Usage\n\nA simple coffee script example:\n\n\tShellEnvironment = require 'shell-environment'\n\t\n\tShellEnvironment.loginEnvironment (error, environment) =>\n\t\tif environment\n\t\t\tchild = ChildProcess.spawn(args[0], args.slice(1), env: environment)\n\t\telse\n\t\t\tconsole.log(error)\n\n### Running Tests\n\nFirst install all dependencies:\n\n\tnpm install\n\nThen run tests:\n\n\t./node_modules/.bin/vows --spec\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Fork it\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\n5.
