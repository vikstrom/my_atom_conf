It currently supports JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Ruby, Python, Bash, Go and anything with a shebang line.\n\n![Example](https://github.com/ioquatix/script-runner/raw/master/resources/screenshot-1.png)\n\nThis package is a fork of the popular `atom-runner` but with many PRs merged and other issues fixed. It includes support for shebang lines (`#!`), correctly setting the environment (e.g. `RVM` supported out of the box) and proper (currently non-interactive) terminal emulation. Many thanks to Loren Segal and all the contributing developers.\n\n## Usage\n\nN.B. these keyboard shortcuts are currently being reviewed, [input is welcome](https://github.com/ioquatix/script-runner/issues/1).\n\n| Command              | Mac OS X          | Linux/Windows    |\n|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Run: Script          | <kbd>ctrl-x</kbd> | <kbd>alt-x</kbd> |\n| Run: Terminate       | <kbd>ctrl-c</kbd> | <kbd>alt-c</kbd> |\n\nScripts which have been saved run in their directory, unsaved scripts run in the workspace root directory.\n\nThe Run: Script command is used script-runner will check if there is already an output view dedicated to the script in the text editor in focus. If there isn't one a new one will be created otherwise it will clear the already existing one and reuse it.\n\nClosing a runner view will cause its process to terminate to avoid losing control over scripts executed with this plugin.\n\n### Pseudo TTY Emulation\n\nMost interpreters output to `stdout` and `stderr`, however the buffering mechanisms are often different when the process is not running on a PTY. For example, Ruby buffers `stdout` when not attached to a terminal which causes incorrect order of output when writing to both `stdout` and `stderr`. Additionally, most programs won't output control codes used for colouring the output when not running on a terminal. `script-runner` uses the `script` command to emulate a terminal and generally gives the best output.\n\n### Shebang Lines\n\nIn a typical UNIX environment, the shebang line specifies the interpreter to use for the script:\n\n```ruby\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\nputs \"Hello World\"\n```\n\nThe shebang line is the preferred way to specify how to run something as it naturally supports all the intricacies of your underlying setup, e.g. Ruby's `rvm`, Python's `virtualenv`.\n\nEven for unsaved files without an associated grammar, as long as you have the correct shebang line it will be executed correctly.\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nThe default Atom process takes environment variables from the shell it was launched from. This might be an issue if launching Atom directly from the desktop environment when using, say, RVM which exports functionality for interactive terminal sessions.\n\nTo ensure consistent behavior, when running a script, environment variables are extracted from the interactive login shell. This usually loads the same environment variables you'd expect when using the terminal.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Fork it\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\n3.
